When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I collaborate with other people on the same project. That is the easiest way for us to share our ideas and improve the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it is possible for other persons to change my code stored in GitHub repository, and those may be the changes I don't want 
	for my code. It also gives me a chance to check out the changes in code before I apply them to my project and decide whether I would
	like to include them or not.
