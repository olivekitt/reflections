When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When I collaborate with other people on the same project. That is the easiest way for us to share our ideas and improve the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it is possible for other persons to change my code stored in GitHub repository, and those may be the changes I don't want 
	for my code. It also gives me a chance to check out the changes in code before I apply them to my project and decide whether I would
	like to include them or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forking is when I copy somebody else's GitHub repository into my own repository on GitHub. I do that if I want to change somebody else's
	code. I can't change it without the owner allowing me to, but I can make a copy of it by forking it, and then I can clone it to my local
	device (onto local repository) and make some changes. I will make a change in a way to keep the original code and make a branch with a 
	new code.
